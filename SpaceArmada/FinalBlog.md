# The end has come

Now that the project is done, I would like to take a second to look back at what I learned, because I did learn a lot.
While I would say that I didn't face all that many technical challenges on the Unity/C# end of things, I did face
challenges pertaining to design, scoping, and the agile mindset.

## Design

The initial design for this project was fairly straight-forward, as we were re-skinning an already existing game (Civilization Wars).
The challenges that came up were more so about the feel and direction of the game, for example controls and how to teach the mechanics to the player.
We ended up wasting a lot of time due to lack of thorough planning and testing on certain aspects, such as the player's control and tutorials.
The controls we wrote at the beginning weren't properly thought through under the lie we told ourselves of "it's just to get it working; we'll redo it later."


We never did.

In fact, the player script written for the prototype has minimal changes since. Had we thought ahead, we would have planned the controls a bit better
to feel better, have more feedback, and be a little more intuitive. By making this mistake, I learned (with the help of mentors) how to predict the look
and feel of a game, and how important look and feel of a game is to the player.

## Scoping

This ties in a little bit with the design, as we were on a fairly strict timeline. Theoretically, any feature can be improved to perfection given enough time, 
but due to our timeline, we ended up ignoring important things such as controls and tutorials. I worked on a tutorial system for about 2 weeks, not understanding 
just how big of a task it is, just to decide that the better approach is to allow the player to fail, or provide more intuitive controls or tutorials. This cost
a lot of development time, and further cemented the lesson learned mentioned above.

## Agile mindset

While before this project I had an understanding of the agile approach to projects, I was never fully sold on its effectiveness. By fully submitting to agile in
this project, I learned just how valuable it is to build a bare-minimum system with the intent to improve on it at a later point. This allows constant testing of the game, 
rather than needing to build the entire game before being able to test anything. This allows for the fun factor to be tested, so we know what needs to be changed sooner
than later.

An example of where this was helpful was for the controls. As mentioned, they weren't great. There was much room for improvement. But the part that agile helped with
there is that we knew that throughout most of the project. Had we tried to build the end product from the start, rather than a prototype, we wouldn't have known the controls
were bad until it was too late.

Mind you, we never fixed the controls, but following an agile mindset allowed us to make that choice not to, rather than us finding out the controls were bad when
it was too late.

## Conclusion

I would say that I learned a lot from this project, and I'm excited to take the experience I've gained to my future professional and hobby careers.
